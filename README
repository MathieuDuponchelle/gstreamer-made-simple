GStreamer is a powerful low-level library.

The application development manual is around 200 pages long, and people
looking for simple multimedia functionnalities will be rebuked by that.

This library intends to fill that gap, even if for now it is quite empty :)

All the boilerplate work is done to create new GObjects here, and have
"bindings" be generated automatically thanks to introspection.

I will fill it as I go, hoping other people will want to choose this library
to centralize general purpose and miscellaneous high level functions and objects,
with the purpose of simplifying GStreamer usage.

I'll start contributing with a video stream comparer based on the ssim element.
